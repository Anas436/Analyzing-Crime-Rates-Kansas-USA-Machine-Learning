# Task Folder Details

Note : Please Follow the below guidelines to create task folders
- Task Folder Naming Convention : _task-n-taskname.(n is the task number)_  ex: task-1-data-analysis, task-2-model-deployment etc.
- All Task folder names should be in chronologial order (from 1 to n)
- All Task folders should have a README.md file with task Details and task goals along with an info table containing all code/notebook files with their links and information
- Task folders that contain sub-tasks can create sub folders within the task.
- __Update the below table explaining the task details.__

### Task Table

| Task No| Task Name | Details |
|-|-|-|
|1| Data collection|Collect datasets from various reliable sources and merge them to form a final dataset for analysis|
|2| Data Analysis  |Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the crime data, identifying trends, patterns, and outliers  |
|3| Data Visualization |Select appropriate visualization techniques, such as bar charts, heatmaps, or geographic maps, to effectively communicate crime data|
|4| ML Model Development |Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for predicting crime rates or classifying crime types based on historical data|
|5| Streamlit App for ML Model Deployment |Design and develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit for deploying the trained ML model|
|6|Political Rationale| The entire basis of the political rationale is to create a document upon which we could use as a basis to know if the direction of our current application is viable or not|
